# Snowflake Simulation for the web
This project implements a Snowflake Simulation using Reiters model. The underlying simulation is written in Rust using WebAssembly and the interactive part is created using Svelte for the web.

## Todo
* Improve web interface, display iteration count, better buttons
* Add inputs for alpha, beta and gamma values to change in realtime
* Test drawing a pixmap instead of hexagons for large sim resolutions
* Experiment with saving 
* Implement zooming into window
